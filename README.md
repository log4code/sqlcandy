# SQLCandy

SQLCandy is (will be) a collection of .NET libraries and tools to assist with developing applications that utilize SQLite.

Each library/tool is standalone and doesn't have direct dependencies on any of the others. This allows for Ã  la carte approch for only what is needed.

SQLCandy tools are VERY opinionated and streamlined. They do not seek to hide or abstract needing to know SQL, only assist with using SQLite.

- **Wrapper** : A SQL generating helper library with a fluent API approach. SQLCandy Wrapper is not an ORM. Its aim is to reduce typing of raw SQL for faster development with less syntax errors.

- **Factory** : (In development). A command line tool to generate .NET classes needed by Wrapper from an existing database. This allows for faster development using Wrapper amd reduces manually creating boilerplate code.

- **Jar** : (In development) A library collection of extension methods to streamline development with SQLite.
